# BTP
Repository of B.Tech Project on Botnet Detection using Network Traffic Behaviour Analysis and Machine Learning <br>
<a>Here we present Behavioral flow based Botnet detection approach using modern Machine Learning techniques such as Latest Classifiers and their combinations using Ensembling Techniques.</a><br>
We also present a custom coded Flow Generator for Flow Identification and feature generation to characterize the network traffic.<br>
Dataset used for analysis: Botnet Dataset by ISCX UNB, Canada <br>
## Index
The description of the files and folders are: <br>
1. Botnet Docs contains some relevant Documents on Botnets and previous work <br>
2. Custom Flow Generator consists of a python implementation to extract the Bidirectional Traffic Flows and generate Flow Based Features to be used later for Machine Learning.<br>
3. ISCXFlowMeterMaster contains Flow generator given by ISCX. However the flow generator used in this project was custom written inline and also abstracted out for Traffic Analysis. <br>
3. Deep Learning Folder contains code for deep learning analysis of dataset and the results <br>
4. Rest are some code files done for analysis in no particular order<br>
